## Logic puzzle

React-redux implementation of a logic puzzle I found online with a React-draggable dependency for being able to properly drag tokens on the game board. And , while this may have been done without redux as well I found it's state model to fit so well with the mechanics of the game (that is the sequence : drag token.. , place token.. , store move..) that I had to try using it!
